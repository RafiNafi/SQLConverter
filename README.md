# SQL to NoSQL-Converter

## Introduction

This project was developed as a part of my bachelor thesis at Aalen University.
It converts standard SQL into Cypher Query Language. 
At the moment it supports only Cypher, but it can be further developed with other NoSQL languages.

The basis of the client application was taken from https://github.com/SimonRuttmann/ERModellingTool and extended appropriately.

The server application was newly created for this project.
